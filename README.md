Create a simple ticketing system. List the current tickets on the main screen along with a button that lets you add a new ticket.

Clicking the New Ticket button should display a form with ```problem```, ```reporting_person```, and ```date_time```

Any added tickets should be reflected in the ticket list but do not have to be stored. Use any method you choose to display the list tickets.
